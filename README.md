# Prop.LL Updater

## What is this?

Prop.LL Updater is specifically used for updating your Prop.LL file for each hospital with the latest **date** and **DB3** file!

## How does this work?

* Prop.LL Updater uses JavaScript's Promises
* It converts the query results into a JavaScript Array
* After setting the root of your folder, it loops through every hospital and updates the dates and DB3 file path
* If there is an error, or a missing file, the program **will still continue** and log out the specific file path to where the error has occured!
